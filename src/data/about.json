My main focus is frontend developing but i do know lil bit about backend. I have willing to learn and explore new kind of technology, but the other hand i know,  i am not a super fast learner. I am not the fast person in solving or adapating but with willing, guidance, consistency, and patience i believe it can be done. I do love talk and discuss about tech, for me discussion is medium to get know a better way and perspective. I think that what i can best do to describe myself, if you want to collaborated, hired me, or just want to know more about me, don't hesitate to contact me via email. Cheers!",
